## üö® Risk Mitigation & Backup Plans

### Technical Risks
**Risk:** Database performance issues with multi-tenancy
**Mitigation:** Have database architect review all schema changes, implement caching strategy early

**Risk:** Frontend complexity with real-time updates
**Mitigation:** Prototype WebSocket integration early, have fallback to polling

**Risk:** POS integration complexity varies significantly
**Mitigation:** Start with one well-documented POS system, create abstraction layer

### Team Risks
**Risk:** Key team member unavailability
**Mitigation:** Ensure at least 2 people understand each critical system, maintain good documentation

**Risk:** Scope creep from stakeholders
**Mitigation:** Product manager acts as gatekeeper, all changes go through formal change request process
